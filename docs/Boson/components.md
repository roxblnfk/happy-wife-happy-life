# Components

<show-structure for="chapter" depth="2"/>

Boson's architecture is built on a collection of versatile components that can 
be used independently of the main framework. These components are designed to 
be flexible and adaptable, allowing developers to integrate them into any web 
project or framework of their choice. 

Whether you're building with Boson or working on a standalone website, these 
components provide powerful functionality without imposing any architectural 
constraints or technical limitations. This modular approach ensures that you 
can use exactly what you need, when you need it, while maintaining complete 
freedom in how you structure and implement your application.
